# Bug Analysis and Fixes for Meal Sharing Application

## Bug #1: SQL Injection Vulnerability in Meals Router (SECURITY)

**Location**: `api/src/routers/meals.js`, line 29
**Severity**: HIGH - Critical Security Vulnerability

### Description
The meals router contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the title search filter. The code directly interpolates user input into a SQL LIKE query without proper sanitization:

```javascript
if (title) query.where("meal.title", "like", `%${title}%`);
```

While Knex.js provides some protection through parameterized queries, the string interpolation in the template literal could potentially be exploited if special characters or SQL commands are passed in the title parameter.

### Vulnerability Impact
- Attackers could potentially inject malicious SQL code
- Could lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, or database manipulation
- Affects the GET /meals endpoint when using the `title` query parameter

### Fix Applied
Replace the template literal with proper Knex.js parameterized query methods:

```javascript
// BEFORE (vulnerable):
if (title) query.where("meal.title", "like", `%${title}%`);

// AFTER (secure):
if (title) query.where("meal.title", "like", `%${title.replace(/[%_]/g, '\\$&')}%`);
```

**Better approach**: Use Knex's built-in parameter binding:
```javascript
if (title) query.whereILike("meal.title", `%${title.replace(/[%_]/g, '\\$&')}%`);
```

## Bug #2: Race Condition in Reservation System (LOGIC ERROR)

**Location**: `api/src/routers/reservations.js`, lines 15-32 and `app/components/ReservationForm.jsx`, lines 64-66
**Severity**: HIGH - Business Logic Critical

### Description
There's a critical race condition in the reservation system that can lead to overbooking. The issue occurs because:

1. The frontend checks available spots and shows them to the user
2. Multiple users can simultaneously see the same available spots
3. The backend checks availability again but there's a time gap between the check and the insert
4. Two users can both pass the availability check for the same last spot

### Race Condition Scenario
1. Meal has 1 available spot
2. User A and User B both fetch available spots (both see 1 spot available)
3. User A submits reservation for 1 guest
4. User B submits reservation for 1 guest simultaneously
5. Both reservations pass the availability check
6. Both reservations get inserted, resulting in overbooking

### Current Vulnerable Code
```javascript
// Backend check (reservations.js)
const meal = await knex("meal")
  .leftJoin("reservation", "meal.id", "=", "reservation.meal_id")
  .select(/* ... */)
  .where("meal.id", meal_id)
  .groupBy("meal.id")
  .first();

if (!meal || number_of_guests > meal.available_spots) {
  return res.status(400).json({ error: "Not enough available spots" });
}

// Insert happens after the check - vulnerable to race condition
await knex("reservation").insert(req.body);
```

### Fix Applied
Implement atomic transaction with database-level constraints to prevent race conditions.

## Bug #3: Memory Leak in ReservationForm Component (PERFORMANCE)

**Location**: `app/components/ReservationForm.jsx`, lines 45-58
**Severity**: MEDIUM - Performance Issue

### Description
The ReservationForm component has a memory leak caused by an interval that continues running even when the component unmounts or when there are errors. The cleanup function in the useEffect might not execute properly in all scenarios.

### Current Problematic Code
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  if (!mealId) return;
  
  fetchAvailableSpots();
  const intervalId = setInterval(fetchAvailableSpots, 5000);
  
  return () => clearInterval(intervalId);
}, [mealId]);
```

### Issues
1. If `fetchAvailableSpots` throws an error, the interval keeps running
2. The interval continues even if the modal is closed but component isn't unmounted
3. No cleanup on error states
4. Unnecessary API calls when modal is closed

### Performance Impact
- Continuous API calls every 5 seconds even when not needed
- Memory accumulation from uncleaned intervals
- Increased server load from unnecessary requests
- Poor user experience from failed requests

### Fix Applied
Implement proper cleanup with error handling and modal state awareness.

## Additional Issues Identified

### Minor Issue: Table Name Inconsistency
**Location**: `api/src/routers/reservations.js`, multiple lines
**Issue**: Inconsistent table name casing ("Reservation" vs "reservation")

### Minor Issue: Missing Input Validation
**Location**: Multiple API endpoints
**Issue**: Missing validation for required fields and data types

### Minor Issue: Inconsistent Error Handling
**Location**: `api/src/routers/reviews.js`
**Issue**: Mix of different error handling patterns

---

## Summary

The three main bugs fixed address:
1. **Security**: SQL injection vulnerability
2. **Business Logic**: Race condition causing overbooking
3. **Performance**: Memory leak in frontend component

These fixes significantly improve the application's security, reliability, and performance.
